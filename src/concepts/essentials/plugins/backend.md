# Plugin Backend

The backend component of Caido is the server responsible for data processing, storage and business logic.

Backend development allows you to:

- Extend the server-side functionality of the Caido application.
- Interact with the application's data, databases and infrastructure.
- Handle authentication, authorization and data calls.
